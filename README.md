To understand how Uniswap works under the hood, I have forked Uniswap v2-core and v2-periphery.

The liquidity provider token in this exchange is called a 'Forked token', whose smart contract is present in the migrator directory.

I have created another smart contract called 'liquidityMigrator.sol' on the migrator directory to bootstrap the liquidity of this exchange by performing a 'liquidity attack' on Uniswap.
